/*Create a base class called shape. Use this class to store two 
double type values that could be use to compute the area of 
figures. Derive two specific classes called triangle and rectangle 
from the base shape. Add get_data() member function to the 
base class to compute and display the area of figure. Make 
display_area() as a virtual function and redefine this function in 
the derived classes to suit their requirements. 
Using these classes design a program that will accept 
dimensions of the triangle or a rectangle interactivly and 
display the area.*/
